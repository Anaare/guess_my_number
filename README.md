**Hints**: After each guess, the game provides hints whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guessed number.

**Winning**: If the player guesses the correct number within the given tries, a message indicating a correct guess will be displayed, and the background color will change to green.

**Losing**: If the player exhausts all the tries without guessing the correct number, a message indicating that they are out of tries will be displayed, and the background color will change to red.
